description:
  "<p>The Stone Barns Team is working with the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture to examine the cycling of organic materials and energy through their property.
   Our specific area of focus for this semester involves harnessing the energy generated by a compost system and using it to heat water, which is then used throughout the property.
   The team is working to optimize and improve this system.
